# CodingChallenge CV4RS

To complete the coding challenge, you have to do the following steps:
1. Install conda or any similar conda-compatible environment manager (e.g. miniconda, mamba, micromamba, ...) on your PC.
2. Create an environment using the [CV4RS_CODE_CHALLENGE_ENV.yaml](CV4RS_CODE_CHALLENGE_ENV.yaml)-environment file.
3. Activate the environment.
4. Run `jupyter lab` to read the [CodingChallenge.ipynb](CodingChallenge.ipynb) notebook.
5. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook.

Some of the outlined steps above don't have to be followed directly. However, your hand-in files **must be runable with an environment according to the steps described above**.
