Inside the training loop, we alternate between training on the training set and evaluating on the validation set. We use the `train` method of the model to set it to training mode during training and evaluation mode during validation. We also use the `torch.no_grad()` context manager to disable gradient computation during validation to save memory.\n\nAfter each epoch, we save the model with the best validation accuracy using `torch.save`. Finally, we plot the training and validation loss and accuracy using Matplotlib.\n\nNote that you may also need to modify the hyperparameters such as the learning rate and the number of epochs to achieve the best performance.",

Then, you can modify the training function to alternate between training on the training set and evaluating on the validation set.\n\nHere's an example modification to the data loader:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# Split dataset into training and validation sets\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Create data loaders for training and validation sets\ntrain_dataset = MyDataset(X_train, y_train)\nval_dataset = MyDataset(X_val, y_val)\ntrain_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)\nval_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)\n```\n\nIn this modification, we use the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn to split the dataset into training and validation sets.

Inside the training loop, we alternate between training on the training set and evaluating on the validation set. We use the `train` method of the model to set it to training mode during training and evaluation mode during validation. We also use the `torch.no_grad()` context manager to disable gradient computation during validation to save memory.\n\nAfter each epoch, we save the model with the best validation accuracy using `torch.save`. Finally, we plot the training and validation loss and accuracy using Matplotlib.\n\nNote that you may also need to modify the hyperparameters such as the learning rate and the number of epochs to achieve the best performance.",
